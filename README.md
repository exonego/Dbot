DiscriminantBot
This is my study project. Telegram bot written on python using aiogram library.
This bot can solve only ordered complete quadratic equations through Discriminant.
You can find all the required packages in the "requirements.txt" file.
You should create a python file 'bot_token.py' in the root folder of the project and a variable 'BOT_TOKEN' with the token of your telegram bot in it.
I don't recommend you to clone this project as it is a very simple bot for my educational practice.
