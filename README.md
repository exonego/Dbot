DiscriminantBot
This is my study project. Telegram bot written on python with aiogram library.
This bot can solve only Ñ‰rdered complete quadratic equations through Discriminant.
You should create a python file 'bot_token' in the root folder of the project and a variable 'BOT_TOKEN' with the token of your telegram bot in it.
I don't recommend you to clone this project as it is a very simple bot for my educational practice.
